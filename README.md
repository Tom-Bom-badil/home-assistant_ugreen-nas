## 🚀 Quick Overview

👉 This project enables **Home Assistant** to monitor settings and operational data of a **UGOS-based UGreen NAS** - *without modifying its operating system in any way*. No extra tools/scripts are installed in UGOS, no ssh access with cryptic shell commands is needed, no difficult container setup is required - we simply use what UGOS already provides.

</p>
<br/>
The integration automatically retrieves and renews access authorization tokens as needed, and queries data from the UGOS-builtin API by using those tokens (the same API that the UGOS Web GUI and the UGOS Apps are using).
